# Animations (keyframes)

Files that can be `@forward`-ed separately for re-using animations.

Mainly to prevent huge bloated keyframes from showing up in _all_ of the output CSS even when it's not using said animations, to prevent going over the MaxLength for custom CSS as is/was in place as per 10-2024.
